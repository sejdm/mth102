<li><p>Let <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> denote a normal random variable with mean <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> and variance <span class="math inline">\(\sigma^2\)</span>. Remember that <span class="math inline">\(\Phi(x)\)</span> is the cumulative function for the <em>standard</em> normal distribution. Prove that <span class="math inline">\(F_X(x) = \Phi\left(\frac{x-\mu}{\sigma}\right)\)</span></p></li>
<li><p>Let <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> denote a normal random variable with mean <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> and variance <span class="math inline">\(\sigma^2\)</span>. Show that</p>
<ol>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(P\{ X &gt; \mu + \sigma\} = 1 - \Phi(1)\)</span></p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(P\{ \mu &lt; X &lt; \mu + \sigma\} = \Phi(1) - \Phi(0)\)</span></p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(P\{ \mu - \sigma &lt; X &lt; \mu \} = \Phi(0) - \Phi(-1)\)</span></p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(P\{ \mu - 2\sigma &lt; X &lt; \mu - \sigma \} = \Phi(2) - \Phi(1)\)</span></p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(P\{ X &lt; \mu - 2\sigma \} = \Phi(-2)\)</span></p></li>
<li><p>In general, derive a formula for <span class="math inline">\(P\{\mu - a \sigma \leq X \leq \mu + b \sigma\}\)</span> in terms of <span class="math inline">\(\Phi\)</span> and observe that it does not depend on the parameters <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span>.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>If the average total marks of a particular class is 50%, and the standard deviation is 20%, then assuming that it is modelled by a normal distribution, estimate the percentage of students who will get an A grade if the cutoff for an A is 95%.</p></li>
<li><p>Show that if the cutoff for an A is set at the mean plus standard deviation for any course, then assuming that it is modelled by a normal distribution, the percentage of students earning an A will always be around <span class="math inline">\(1 - \Phi(1)\)</span></p></li>
<li><p>Consider a random variable with probability density function <span class="math inline">\(f_X(x) = \lambda e^{-\lambda x}\)</span> when <span class="math inline">\(x \geq 0\)</span> and 0 when <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> is negative.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Show that <span class="math inline">\(f_X\)</span> is a valid density function</p></li>
<li><p>Find <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{E}[X]\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{Var}(X)\)</span></p></li>
<li><p>Show that <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> satisfies he property that <span class="math inline">\(P\{X &gt; a + b | X &gt; a\} = P\{X &gt; b\}\)</span>. That is that assuming that we know that <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> is bigger than <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span>, then the probability that <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> is bigger than <span class="math inline">\(a+b\)</span> is the same as the probability that <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> is bigger than <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>Assume that the probability that a certain component of a laptop fails after a certain time follows an exponential distribition with an average of 7 years. What is the probability that that component of your laptop will last longer than 1 <em>more</em> year? Note that because of the previous part, you need not know when the component was made. All you know is it has lasted for some (uknown) time <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> until now.</p></li>
<li><p>Assume that the duration a person spends on the phone follows an exponential probability distribition with an average of 20 minutes. You walk into a room and find someone on their phone (you do not know when they started. All you know is that the person is still spending time on their phone, and so since they have started they have spent at least some uknown time <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> on the phone.). What is the probability that they will spend at least 2 minutes more on their phone?</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Let <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> denote the uniform distribution on the interval (0, 1). Let <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> denote the random variable satisfying <span class="math inline">\(Y= X^3\)</span>. Find a probability density function for <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>. (<em>Hint:</em> You will need to use the cumulative function and its interpetation as a probability)</p></li>
<li><p>It is known that for very large <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> the binomial distribution is approximated by the normal distribution with the same mean and variance (Unlike the Poisson, we do not need <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> to be relatively small, and also unlike Poisson this time it is continuous).</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Use this to find the probability of getting more than 90% heads if the probability of getting a head is 0.7 in <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> tosses where <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> is very large. Leave your answer in terms of <span class="math inline">\(\Phi\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>In general, if <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> is binomial random variable with <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> very large, what do you think the following probability should approximately be in terms of <span class="math inline">\(\Phi\)</span>? <span class="math display">\[P\left\{ a &lt; \frac{X - np}{\sqrt{np(1-p)}} &lt; b\right\}\]</span></p></li>
