<li><p>Show that if the probability of <span class="math inline">\(P(E|F) = P(E|F^c)\)</span> then <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span> is independent of <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span>. In other words, if the probability of <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span> remains unchanged whether <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span> occurs or does not occur, then <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span> must be independent of <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>Show that if <span class="math inline">\(P(E|F^c)=0\)</span>, then <span class="math inline">\(P(F|E)=1\)</span>. Can you give a real life interpetation of this?</p></li>
<li><p>Show that <span class="math inline">\(P(A\cap B\cap C) = P(A)P(B|A)P(C|A \cap B)\)</span></p></li>
<li><p>Show that <span class="math inline">\(P(E_1\cap E_2\cap E_3\cap E_4) = P(E_1)P(E_2|E_1)P(E_3|E_1 \cap E_2)P(E_4|E_1\cap E_2\cap E_3)\)</span></p></li>
<li><p>If a deck of playing cards is divided into 4 piles of 13 cards each then what is the probability that each pile has at least one ace.</p></li>
<li><p>If a pair of dice is rolled and we know that the numbers on it are different, what is the probability that one of them is a 4?</p></li>
<li><p>Suppose 90% of all the students who attend the lectures regularly pass a certain course. While, only 30% of students who do not attend the lectures regularly pass the course. If I know that a student passed the course, what is the probability that that student attended regularly? Assume that half the students attended the course regularly.</p></li>
<li><p>Prove that if <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span> are independent events, then so is <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(F^c\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>If three cards are in a box so that one card has both sides black, another has has both sides white, and the remaining card has one side black and one side white. If a card is picked at random and is found to have one side white, what is the probability that the other side is black?</p></li>
<li><p>A scientist has four competing hypothesis, say <span class="math inline">\(H_1\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(H_2\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(H_3\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(H_4\)</span> for a particular phenomenon. Initially, the scientist assumes that <span class="math inline">\(H_1\)</span> is very likely and believes the probability to be around 0.7. However, the scientist believes that the other 3 hypotheses are equally likely. To test this the scientist performs an experiment and obtains some outcome <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span>. Unfortunately, the experiment is not foolproof. If <span class="math inline">\(H_1\)</span> were true, then the probability of the experimental outcome being <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span> is 0.1. If <span class="math inline">\(H_2\)</span> were true, then <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span> willstill occur with probability 0.8. If <span class="math inline">\(H_3\)</span> were true, then the probability of the experimental outcome being <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span> is 0.2, and if <span class="math inline">\(H_4\)</span> were true, then the probability of the experimental outcome being <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span> is 0.1. How should the scientiest update the probabilities of <span class="math inline">\(H_1\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(H_2\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(H_3\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(H_4\)</span>, now that the experiment has been performed and resulted in outcome <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span>. Which hypothesis does the scientist now believe is most probable? Which hypothesis does the scientist now believe is most probable?</p></li>
