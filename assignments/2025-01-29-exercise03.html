<li><p>If a pair of dice is rolled and we know that the numbers on it are different, what is the probability that one of them is a 4?</p></li>
<li><p>Suppose 90% of all the students who attend the lectures regularly pass a certain course. While, only 30% of students who do not attend the lectures regularly pass the course. If I know that a student passed the course, what is the probability that that student attended regularly? Assume that half the students attended the course regularly.</p></li>
<li><p>Prove that if <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span> are independent events, then so is <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(F^c\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>If three cards are in a box so that one card has both sides black, another has has both sides white, and the remaining card has one side black and one side white. If a card is picked at random and is found to have one side white, what is the probability that the other side is black?</p></li>
