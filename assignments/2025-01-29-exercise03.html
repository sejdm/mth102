<li><p>If a pair of dice is rolled and we know that the numbers on it are different, what is the probability that one of them is a 4?</p></li>
<li><p>Suppose 90% of all the students who attend the lectures regularly pass a certain course. While, only 30% of students who do not attend the lectures regularly pass the course. If I know that a student passed the course, what is the probability that that student attended regularly? Assume that half the students attended the course regularly.</p></li>
<li><p>Prove that if <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span> are independent events, then so is <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(F^c\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>If three cards are in a box so that one card has both sides black, another has has both sides white, and the remaining card has one side black and one side white. If a card is picked at random and is found to have one side white, what is the probability that the other side is black?</p></li>
<li><p>A scientist has four competing hypothesis, say <span class="math inline">\(H_1\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(H_2\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(H_3\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(H_4\)</span> for a particular phenomenon. Initially, the scientist assumes that <span class="math inline">\(H_1\)</span> is very likely and believes the probability to be around 0.7. However, the scientist believes that the other 3 hypotheses are equally likely. To test this the scientist performs an experiment and obtains some outcome <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span>. Unfortunately, the experiment is not foolproof. If <span class="math inline">\(H_1\)</span> were true, then the probability of the experimental outcome being <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span> is 0.1. However, if <span class="math inline">\(H_2\)</span> were true, then <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span> may still occur with probability 0.8. If <span class="math inline">\(H_3\)</span> were true, then the probability of the experimental outcome being <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span> is 0.2, and if <span class="math inline">\(H_4\)</span> were true, then the probability of the experimental outcome being <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span> is 0.1. How should the scientiest update the probabilities of <span class="math inline">\(H_1\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(H_2\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(H_3\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(H_4\)</span>, now that the experiment has been performed and resulted in outcome <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span>. Which hypothesis does the scientist now believe is most probable? Which hypothesis does the scientist now believe is most probable?</p></li>
